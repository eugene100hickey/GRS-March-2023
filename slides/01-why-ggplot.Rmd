Welcome to the workshop on ggplot.

Where we'll show you how to create impressive data visualisations.

# Target Audience

- graduate students looking for better ways to present their data  

- people currently using tools like MS Excel for visualisations

---

# Why R?

- working with a mouse isn't reproducible  
  - difficult to log exactly what you've done
  - hard to repeat for a series of diagrams
  - difficult to be inspired by other people's work
  
- good to separate sources of data and the visualisations that disply them

- R uses series of commands that input, manipulate, and display data

- lots of contributors around the world, diverse fields

---

# Course Contents

1. System Configuration - installing software
2. Using RStudio
3. Introduction to R
4. Getting and Cleaning Data
5. Exploratory Analysis - making rough plots
6. Different Types of Plots
7. Playing with Aesthetics
8. Using Plotting Themes
9. Advanced Topics - Maps, Networks

---

## Why We're Here

- Alternative to Excel, and Tableau
- Enables Reproducible Research
- Can Make Lots of Plots Quickly
    - Good for Exploratory Analysis
- Publication Ready Figures

---

## And.... a gateway to so much more

- data capture
- statistical analysis
- machine learning
- artificial intelligence
- writing your thesis
- writing a blog

---

## Not Why We're Here

- Won't discuss choices for data presentation
- Nor good practices in visualisations
    - but these are sort of in the background
- This isn't a machine learning course
    - but lots of the techniques we'll use are relevant
- So, this course it about skills development, how you use these is up to you.

---

## We said we wouldn't discuss this....but

- Graphics are important, overlooked, and inconsistent
   - the last mile of data analysis
- Need to tell a story
- Can be misleading, almost always by accident
- Choice of colours - we'll spend some time on this
- Choice of fonts
- Keep it simple - reduce amount of ink
- Increasing number of options for showcasing your data

---


# Lots of addin packages for ggplot


`r read_csv("data/my-packages.csv")$packages`


---

# And others, that make ggplots that can then be modified and treated as such

```{r}
pi
```



---

# Other reasons

- ggplot is easy to make publication-ready  

- easier to make sequence of visualisations  

- fits in nicely with the rest of the tidyverse

# Let's Begin

---

## Install R and RStudio

---

### *R*
- Go to [*CRAN*](https://cran.r-project.org/)

### *RStudio*

- this is the IDE we will use (and pretty much everyone else uses)
- R is the engine, RStudio is the cockpit
- download from [*RStudio*](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

---

## Using RStudio 

- toolbar across the top
    - I don't use this very much
- set of quick links below that
    - top left (green plus sign) is about the only one I use
- 4 Panes
    - top left for files or looking at data
    - bottom left for the console
    - top right for *Environment* - tells what variables are stored
    - bottom right for plots and help
    
---

[This](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/#section-welcome) is a nice tutorial suite to explain installing R and RStudio:

---

<img src="images/rstudio.PNG" height="600px" width="800px" align="center"/> 

---

- usual work flow is:
    - try commands out at the console (bottom left)
    - when that works, store them in a file (top left)
    - when sequence of commands works, put them into a document (also top left)

---
 
## Extending R

- installing R just gives you *base* R
- beauty of this tool lies with *packages*
- we'll look at installing these from three sources:
    - CRAN
    - Bioconductor
    - github

---

- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
    - example, on console type *install.packages("tidyverse")*
    - this installs the tidyverse package (or rather, family of packages)
    - over 20k packages on CRAN (see list [here](http://cran.nexr.com/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html))
    - sometimes esoteric ([engsoccerdata](http://cran.nexr.com/web/packages/engsoccerdata/index.html))
    - sometimes cutting edge ([deep learning](http://cran.nexr.com/web/packages/keras/index.html))
    - each package heavily curated and maintained
    
---

- [Bioconductor](www.bioconductor.org)
    - set of bioinformatics packages (lots of genomics)
    - start with *install.packages("BiocManager")*
    - then *BiocManager::install("some_genomics_package")* to use
    - list of packages [here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html)
    - about 3,000 packages, including genome builds
    
---

- github
    - packages in development
    - start with *install.packages("devtools")*
    - then *devtools::install_github("developer_name/package_name")*
    - almost 80k packages [here](http://rpkg.gepuro.net/)
    - the package *githubinstall* is useful to search these
