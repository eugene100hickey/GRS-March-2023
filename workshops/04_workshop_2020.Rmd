<ol>
<li> make a histogram of the county areas from the *midwest* dataset from *ggplot2*
<li> make a density plot of the county areas from the *midwest* dataset from *ggplot2*
<li> make a density plot of the county areas from the *midwest* dataset from *ggplot2* which has five different lines for each of the five states
<li> see if you can reproduce the plot using the *midwest* dataset show below. Hint, *scale_x_log10* will be useful


```{r pop, echo = F, warning = F, message=F, fig.height=4}
library(tidyverse)
midwest %>% ggplot(aes(poptotal)) + geom_histogram() + scale_x_log10()
```
